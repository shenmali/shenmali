### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an AI/ML enthusiast with an ambitious mindset, always seeking the next challenge and never settling until I find a meaningful solution. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy sharing knowledge as much as I enjoy learning from others.

About me:

- ðŸ¤– Iâ€™m currently working on AI/ML projects involving LLMs, VLMs, and generative models
- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m building custom workflows using ComfyUI and fine-tuning models like Stable Diffusion (SD Flux)
- ðŸ“Š Iâ€™m passionate about NLP, computer vision, and data-driven problem solving
- ðŸš€ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on applied AI/ML research and real-world use cases
- ðŸ§© I love exploring emerging tools and trends in deep learning and multimodal systems
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about LLMs, ComfyUI, RAG pipelines, or anything AI-related!
